## Project Overview

The Odin Recipes project is a web development project focusing on building a recipe website. The project is divided into iterations, each introducing new concepts and skills. Here's an overview of what each iteration covers:

### Iteration 1: Main Page
- Created the main project directory and index.html file.
- Added the basic HTML structure and an h1 heading for the main page.

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
- Created a recipe directory and individual HTML files for recipes.
- Linked the recipe pages to the main index page.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
- Added content to the recipe pages, including images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps.

### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
- Expanded the project by adding two more recipes with similar page structures.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Main page with links to individual recipes.
- **recipes/**: Directory containing individual recipe pages.
- **recipes/** : Directory containing individual recipe images.

## Getting Started
